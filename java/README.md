# Java example for the XING API

This example uses [Scribe](https://github.com/fernandezpablo85/scribe-java). To make this run you have to add the [Apache Commons Codec](http://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-codec) as well.

You can simply execute the source file which guides you to the flow of using the XING Api.
